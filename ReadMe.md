# SQL-Python-JS Generative Artificial Intelligence Web Application 

## Overview
- This project implements a postgreSQL relational database, FastAPI REST backend server, and reactJS frontend client for a generative AI web application. Users can upload and store data, choose from transformer models to generate text, images, or audio, and run inference on other ML tasks such as retrieval augmented generation using LLMs to perform document question and answering, object detection using detection transformer, or speech recognition & translation.

 - Each project component (database, backend server, frontend client) can be setup and run independently, but are meant to be integrated as part of a full stack web application. Key features and steps to run the project are detailed below
